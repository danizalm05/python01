"""
The function check_password(password) is used by a safe with 4-digits passwords,
and is susceptible to timing attacks.
More specifically, it takes it around 0.1 seconds to check one digit â€“ so
brute-forcing all the possible combinations will take more than an hour.
Can you implement a way to crack its password in less than a minute?
