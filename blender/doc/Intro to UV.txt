 Step 1: Add “UV sphere” 
    
 Step 2: Marking the UV Seam 
        
     a:  select an initial vertex  at  the equator of the sphere.
     b:  Alt + left mouse button, on the vertex just beside the previously
         selected vertex. This selects the whole edge.
     c:  Ctrl + E and select “Mark Seam”. 
         If you accidentally mark the  wrong seam, you can simply clear 
         that seam by pressing Ctrl + E  and then selecting “Clear Seam”.


 Step 3: Unwrapping the Object 
 
      a: Move to  “UV Editing”  mode. 
      b: Select the whole object(Press A on the keyboard) .
      c: Press U on the keyboard to unwrap the object.

  In the UV Editor, you’ll now see the unwrapped version of your object
   as distinct   pieces, which are called UV islands.


 Step 4: Adding the Texture 

      a: Download a texture to your device
      b: Load the texture by clicking on “Image” followed by “Open Image” 
        in the top bar of the UV Editor  ( Alt + O   ).
      c: Select the UV islands by clicking on one vertex of the island 
        and then hitting L on the keyboard.
      d:Align the UV islands to the added images by using the scale, move, 
      and rotate tools, which can be found in the left side column of the 
      UV Editor.

 
 Step 5: Checking the Unwrap 
 
      a: Click on the small arrow at the top right corner of the UV Editor 
       (left window)
      b: Click on the   “Display Stretch” option. This will show a heat map over the 
      image editor, and thus show where the UV is being stretched.

       If the UV is completely blue, that means it’s not stretched. 
       If you find the UV is stretched, you’ll have to add more seams 
       and unwrap the UV again by following steps 2 and 3.
 
 
 Step 6: Finalizing the Image 
 
       
      a: Go to Material Properties in the 3D Viewport and click on 
         the small circle beside the Base Color.
      b: Click “Image Texture”.  Selecting the image file from the device.
